	<h1><span>Capitan America</span></h1>
	<p class="cap-A">Captain America is a superhero created by <i>Joe Simon and Jack Kirby</i> who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on <del>December 20, 1940</del> by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steve Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an American flag-inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield, Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="cap-A">The character quickly emerged as Timely's most popular and commercially successful wartime creation upon his original publication, though the popularity of superheroes declined towards the end of the war and into the post-war period, and Captain America Comics was discontinued in 1950. The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953 before returning to comics in 1964, and has since remained in continuous publication. Captain America's creation as an explicitly anti-Nazi figure was a consciously political undertaking: Simon and Kirby were stridently opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and supporters of U.S. intervention in <mark backgroud-color="blue">World War II</mark>, with Simon conceiving of the character specifically in response to the American non-interventionism movement.</p>
