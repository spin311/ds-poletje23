	<br>
	<p class="p"><i>Digital learning</i> is meant to enhance the learning experience rather than replace traditional methods altogether. Listed below are common pedagogies, or practices of teaching, that combine technology and learning:[citation needed]

    Blended/hybrid learning
    Online learning
    Flipped learning
    1:1 learning
    Differentiated learning
    Individualized learning
    Personalized learning
    Gamification
    Understanding by Design (UBD)</p>

    <h1 id="druginaslov" class="naslov">Pros of Digital Learning</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="p">Digital learning has many beneficial outcomes, one of which is the studentâ€™s ability to work at his/her own pace. With assignments being online students can decide when they want to complete them. If they work best in the morning, they can do them in the morning. On the other hand, if they work best in the evening, they can complete the assignments in the evening. Without having the stress and time limitations of being in a classroom, they can take as long or as little time as they need. This allows them to understand the concept and retain the knowledge fully.
    Digital learning offers many environmental benefits. Online education relies strictly on digital documents, therefore reducing paper waste and the amount of trees cut down. Studies show that using ebooks as opposed to traditional textbooks would save more than 28,000 trees per million books. Another environmental benefit of digital learning is that it reduces transportation. Completing assignments online as opposed to commuting to class reduces carbon dioxide emissions in the environment by about 148 pounds each semester. </p>
