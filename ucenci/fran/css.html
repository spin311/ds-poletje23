		<tr>
			<th>Where does it live?</td>
			<td>It was purportedly able to live both on land and in water, and was said to live in the Olympic National Forest and nearby rivers</td>
			<td>woods, bogs, marshes, and fields.</td>
			<td>They are found in marine waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans at depths between 100 m and 2800 m.</td>
			<td>The crustaceans were found near the Pacific-Antarctic ridge, south of Easter Island, along hydrothermal vents</td>
			<td>They live near the sea bottom in specific locations in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>What does it eat?</td>
			<td>Does not eat anything</td>
			<td>This carnivore eats a variety of aquatic insect larvae like caddisflies and midges, but will also eat earthworms, 
			small fish, and snails.</td>
			<td>These animals are lie-in-wait predators, meaning they sit at the bottom of the ocean and eat anything that passes by, such as crustaceans, brittle stars, anemone, and carrion. This allows them to preserve energy, which is key to their survival.</td>
			<td>Shaggy-clawed deep-sea crabs grow bacteria to eat, study finds. The "yeti" crab farms bacteria on its furry arms as its main source of food, scientists say.</td>
			<td>The goblin shark feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as rattails and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods.</td>	
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>What are its natural predators?</td>
			<td>bald eagles and sasquatches</td>
			<td>Predators. Raptors, including screech, great horned, long-eared, barred, and barn owls, and red-tailed hawks; mammals such as striped skunks, weasels, minks, and foxes; and fish such as the northern pike prey on this mammal.</td>
			<td>Has no predators</td>
			<td>Bacteria, mussels, octopus, fish</td>
			<td>Since these sharks live very deep in the ocean, they are unlikely to have many predators. However, some researchers believe that blue sharks might attack and eat goblin sharks</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>What is one intersenting fact about it?</td>
			<td>The Pacific Northwest tree octopus is an Internet hoax created in 1998 by Lyle Zapato</td>
			<td>Star-nosed Moles are excellent swimmers and have even been observed swimming under ice.</td>
			<td>Unlike many other fish species, blobfish don't have scales - instead, they have loose, flabby skin.</td>
			<td>The yeti crab (Kiwa hirsuta ), an unusual, hairy crab with no eyes, was discovered in 2005 on a hydrothermal vent near Easter Island. It represents not only a new species but also a new genusâ€”Kiwa, after the mythological Polynesian goddess of shellfish.</td>
			<td>These pink animals can grow 12 feet long and weigh up to 460 pounds.</td>
